## E. Methods, Governance, and Fairness (Concise)
- Techniques used: time‑series trend, categorical comparisons; charts generated via Matplotlib.
- Governance: minimum‑necessary data, de‑identification, access controls, drift monitoring, audit trail.
- Fairness: subgroup calibration/parity checks; remediation through re‑weighting/constraints where gaps identified.

### Confidence (per key claim)
- ~40% claims increase (2023–2025): Confidence 3/5 — uncertainty: sample size, coding mix.
- Regional approval gap (Sydney vs Regional NSW): Confidence 4/5 — supported by embedded table/visual.
- Readmissions vary by demographic: Confidence 3/5 — needs richer longitudinal severity data.

## F. Provenance
- Prompt specification: authored in `docs/prompt.xml`.
- Charts and tables generated by `scripts/generate_charts.py`; images exported to `charts/images/`.

### Verification notes
- Horizon alignment: 2019–2025 (focus 2023–2025) — PASS
- Additivity checks: yearly totals and table sums reconcile with visuals — PASS
- Regional consistency: approval rates in tables match embedded chart — PASS
- Unverified items: provider density and wait-time benchmarks — Unverified; validation: cross-reference external workforce datasets.
