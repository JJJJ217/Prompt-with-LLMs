# Prompt for Mental Health Claims Analysis

## Prompt Used to Generate Analysis

**Scenario:**
HealthGuard Insurance has noticed concerning trends in their mental health claims data:

1. Mental health claims increased 40% from 2023-2025.
2. Their actuarial models (built in 2019) are consistently underestimating costs.
3. Therapist reimbursement requests show high regional variation (Sydney: 85% approval, Regional NSW: 62%).
4. Patient readmission rates for anxiety/depression treatment vary significantly by demographic.

**Task:**
Using Microsoft CoPilot, conduct a comprehensive analysis addressing the following:

1. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify factors that the 2019 models are likely missing that explain the 40% increase. Consider post-pandemic behavioral health trends, telehealth adoption, changing diagnostic patterns, and socioeconomic shifts.

2. **Data Gap Identification:** Recommend new data sources that HealthGuard should incorporate into their models. Consider both structured data (claims, demographics) and unstructured data (clinical notes, patient feedback).

3. **Regional Disparity Investigation:** Analyze why approval rates differ significantly by region and what systemic issues this might reveal.

4. **Ethical Risk Assessment:** Discuss ethical concerns that arise when using behavioral health data for predictive modeling. Address how to manage patient privacy, algorithmic bias, and mental health stigma.
